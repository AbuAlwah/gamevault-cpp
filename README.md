# gamevault-cpp
A console-based C++ game store and library management system with user and admin roles, purchase tracking, and persistent data storage.

# GameVault 🎮

GameVault is a console-based C++ application that simulates a digital game store and personal game library.

The system supports both users and administrators, each with distinct permissions. Users can browse and purchase games, while administrators can manage the store inventory and users.

All operations such as purchases, additions, and updates are persisted using file handling, ensuring data consistency between sessions.

## Key Features
- User and Admin roles with different permissions
- Game purchasing and ownership tracking
- Persistent data storage using files
- Clean and scalable project structure
- Written entirely in C++

## Project Status
This project is actively evolving. Future updates will focus on improving code modularization, file handling structure, and overall maintainability.
